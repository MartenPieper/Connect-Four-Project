# Connect-Four-Project
Description: In this game players take turns dropping their pieces into one of seven columns that have six rows of slots. 
The first player to get their pieces into four slots that are vertically, horizontally, or diagonally contiguous wins the game.

Personal Note: 
This game was programmed solely using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. I used a simple menu and sounds to create a realistic game environment. 
I designed my game as a hommage to two video game classics- Pong & Tetris.
