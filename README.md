# Connect-Four-Project
In this game players take turns dropping their pieces into one of seven columns that have six rows of slots. 
The first player to get their pieces into four slots that are vertically, horizontally, or diagonally contiguous wins the game.


Personal Note: 

I designed my game to be a hommage to two classics- Pong & Tetris.
